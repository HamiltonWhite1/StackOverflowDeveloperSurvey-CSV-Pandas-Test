# StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey-CSV-Pandas-Test

This is a repository for Pandas filters I created as tests to study the Pandas library for Python.
This practice was done in Jupyter Notebook, and features filters for developer income based on geography, people who identify with a different sexual orientation
and what roles they hold professionally, changing the names of rows and columns as well as changing a data value, as well as more broad filters such as
filtering by developers in a particular country.
