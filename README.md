# StackOverflowDeveloperSurvey-CSV-Pandas-Test

This is a repository for Pandas filters I created as a test to study the Pandas library for Python.
This practice was done in Jupyter Notebook, and features filters for developer income based on geography, people who identify with a different sexual orientation
and what roles they hold professionally, changing the names of rows and columns as well as changing data values, as well as more broad filters such as
filtering by which countries each developer lives in.
